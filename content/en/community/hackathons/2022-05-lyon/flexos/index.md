[FlexOS](https://github.com/project-flexos/) is an OS allowing users to easily specialize the safety and isolation strategy of an OS at compilation/deployment time, instead of design time. Depending on the configuration, the same FlexOS code can mimic a microkernel with multiple address-spaces, a single-address-space OS with Intel MPK compartments, or many other OS isolation approaches.

This talk gives an overview of FlexOS and the research prospects of unikernels and isolation.

The session will be divided in two parts: first, a presentation of FlexOS (similar to the one done at ASPLOS), followed by a more technical, hands-on session.
